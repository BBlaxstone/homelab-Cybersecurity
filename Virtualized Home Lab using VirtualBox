Virtualized Home Lab using VirtualBox
Created by Bryan Blaxstone
I built a virtualized environment using VirtualBox, featuring two virtual machines: one running Ubuntu for network management and another running Kali Linux for security testing.
•	Setup Process: Installed VirtualBox and its Extension Pack, followed by Ubuntu and Kali Linux ISOs to create and configure the VMs.
•	Networking: Configured a NAT network to ensure secure internet access and isolation from the host machine. On Ubuntu, I implemented UFW for firewall management, enabling SSH and specific IP access. On Kali Linux, I utilized tools like Nmap and Wireshark for network scans and traffic analysis.
•	Security Testing: Leveraged the Metasploit Framework on Kali Linux for penetration testing and security evaluations.
Technologies Used:
•	Virtualization: VirtualBox
•	Operating Systems: Ubuntu and Kali Linux
•	Networking: NAT Network, UFW
•	Security Tools: Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit Framework
Key Skills Gained:
•	Setting up and managing virtual machines
•	Installing and configuring Linux operating systems
•	Designing and managing secure network configurations
•	Conducting network scans, traffic analysis, and basic penetration testing
This project strengthened my hands-on experience with virtualization, network management, and security tools, providing a practical foundation for creating secure and functional virtual environments.
